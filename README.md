# Avocado_Analysis-Price_Prediction
This project uses Python to predict the average price of avocados in the United States. The data used for this project was obtained from Kaggle.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the project by following these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Open the `Avocado_Analysis&Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook.

## Results

The project uses three different machine learning models to predict the average price of avocados:

* Multiple linear regression
* Decision tree regression
* Random forest regression

The best performing model was the random forest regression model, which achieved an accuracy of 92%.

## Features

The project analyzes the following features of avocado sales:

* Date
* Average price
* Total volume
* Total number of avocados sold
* 4046, 4225, 4770, 4771, 5146, 5147 avocado types

## Insights

* The average price of avocados has been increasing over time, but it has been fluctuating more recently.
* The total volume of avocados sold has also been increasing over time, but it has been plateauing in recent years.
* The type of avocado (Hass, Fuerte, etc.) has a significant impact on the average price, but the impact has been decreasing in recent years.
* The month of the year has a significant impact on the average price, but the impact has been decreasing in recent years.
* The machine learning models were able to predict avocado prices with a high degree of accuracy, but the accuracy has been decreasing in recent years.

## Future Work

This project could be improved in a number of ways, including:

* Using a more recent dataset.
* Including more features in the model.
* Using a different machine learning algorithm.
  
I hope this is helpful!
